# Change Log
This change log serves as documentation of the changes made to the data reporting formats. Version numbering follows Major.Minor.Patch versioning schema. The versioning schema is defined as the following:
 - Major = updates with significant enough changes that it is no longer backwards compatible with the previous version.
 - Minor = updates that modify text significantly (for example, a change in a term’s definition) within the data reporting format but not the overall structure of the reporting format.
 - Patch = updates that include very minor changes such as fixing a typo

 The latest release of all materials is v2.0.0. Refer to the sections below for information regarding each release.

## v2.0.0
The v2.0.0 data reporting formats and cross-walk tables incorporated feedback received from the Technical Working Group on v1.0.0. Since the feedback received was based on the initial release, feedback was significant and warranted numerous changes to the data reporting formats and cross-walk tables.

### Groundwater Elevation Feedback Themes
 - Positive feedback on what attributes are included and required/optional fields
 - Additional clarifications needed on the purpose of the crosswalk and reporting format
 - Highlights the need for unique well identifiers
 - Varying opinions on what elevations should be included each time a measurement is reported
 - Need for standardizing elevation datums
 - Varying opinions on what attributes should or should not be included in the reporting format – elevations and calculated fields

### Well Characteristics Feedback Themes
- Highlighted issues and inconsistencies in current well IDs used across programs​
- Highlights the need for unique well identifiers​
- Any geographic related qualifiers (GW Basin, County, etc.) should be determined on the back-end through GIS
    - Boundaries may change over time requiring updates to these qualifiers​
- Need for standardizing coordinate system and vertical datum​
- Allow users to provide notes when options such as “Other” or “Unknown” are selected (include conditional notes fields)​
- Language modified to improve clarity

## v1.0.0
The v1.0.0 data reporting formats and cross-walk tables were published for feedback from the Technical Working Group on March 27th, 2023. For this reason, the changelog for v1.0.0 is left blank.
